# Portfolio
Hey there! Welcome to my portfolio. This is the code hosting my current website *(that may or may not be broken)* and can be found live at [here!](https://foxxo.zip)

Sorry about the broken form, I can't be arsed to fix it at this point in time :3

I would like to give a huge thanks to [cnrad](https://github.com/cnrad) and [callumok2004](https://github.com/callumok2004) for the Spotify Status code. That is not mines, and I'm sure to give credit where credit is due.

If you want to clone and use this site for your own purposes, go ahead! But please make sure to credit me in your readme.

Thank you!
